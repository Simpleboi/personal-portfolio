      <p>What makes someone a bad person? That's a question that first crossed my mind when I was about fourteen years old, randomly, while playing <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em> with my cousin Jason. At the time, it felt like one of those questions that had a simple answer: a bad person is someone who does bad things. Easy enough, right? Someone who lies, steals, or hurts others must be “bad.” But as I've grown older, I've realized that the question isn't simple at all. The line between good and evil isn't as clear as I once thought, it's blurred by circumstance, intention, and perspective.
      <br />
      <br />
      I remember that conversation vividly. My cousin paused between rounds and asked, “<em>Do you think someone is born evil, or are they taught to be?</em>” That question stuck with me for years. Personally, I don't believe anyone is born evil. A baby doesn't come into this world with hatred in their heart or cruelty in their mind. What we call “good” or “bad” behavior is something we learn through the people around us and the society we live in. Morality isn't something built into our DNA, it's something shaped, molded, and reinforced by culture, environment, and experience.
      <br />
      <br />
      What we consider moral or ethical is often just what's socially accepted at a given time and place. Every society draws its own lines between what's right and wrong, and those lines are constantly shifting. To me, that means morality is less about absolute truth and more about shared belief.
      <br />
      <br />
      Let me give you an example. Imagine a poor, hungry child who walks into a convenience store and steals a candy bar because he hasn't eaten in days. Would you call that child a bad person? Some people would say yes, because stealing is stealing, no matter the reason. Others would say no, because he was just trying to survive. Both sides have a point.
      <br />
      <br />
      But that scenario reveals something deeper: people are often willing to justify “wrong” actions if the reason behind them feels morally acceptable. It's almost as if morality bends depending on the situation and who's involved. The same action, stealing, can be seen as either heartless or human depending on the lens through which we view it.
      <br />
      <br />
      Now let's flip the situation. A family is asleep in their home when an intruder breaks in and kills the father. In a desperate attempt to protect her children, the mother grabs a weapon and kills the intruder. Technically, she committed murder. But would anyone call her a bad person for it? Probably not. In fact, most people would see her as heroic. That raises another uncomfortable truth: sometimes an act that's considered “wrong” in one context can be seen as “right” in another.
      <br />
      <br />
      When I talk to people about these ideas, I always hear different answers. Everyone's sense of morality seems to be filtered through their own experiences. Someone who grew up in a violent home might see aggression as a natural response to fear. Someone raised in love might see forgiveness as the only answer. Our environment teaches us how to define good and evil, and sometimes, those definitions clash.
      <br />
      <br />
      History makes this even clearer. Four hundred years ago, slavery was not only accepted but encouraged. Many white families in the 1600s genuinely believed they were doing nothing wrong. They were raised to think slavery was normal, even moral. Today, we look back and see it for what it truly was, one of the greatest injustices in human history. That drastic change in perception proves how fragile and flexible morality can be.
      <br />
      <br />
      As I've gotten older, I've also had to confront my own mistakes, the kind that lingers in the back of your mind long after they've happened. I've made poor choices and committed offenses that I deeply regret. Some of them came from ignorance, others from anger or pride. At times, I hurt people I cared about, and for a while, I believed those moments defined me. But with time, I realized that a person isn't measured only by the worst things they've done. What truly matters is whether they choose to stay that way or become someone better.
      <br />
      <br />
      I don't see myself as a bad person because of my past. I see myself as someone who's learning. I try to counter my wrongs with good deeds, with empathy, honesty, and self-awareness. Each act of kindness, each apology, and each effort to grow feels like another step toward redemption. I've learned that being human means being flawed, but it also means having the extraordinary ability to change. We're not fixed beings, we evolve, we stumble, and we rebuild.
      <br />
      <br />
      I grew up believing certain things simply because that's what I was taught. As a kid, I accepted everything I heard as truth. But as I got older and began to think critically for myself, I started questioning everything, what is right, what is wrong, and who even gets to decide. That shift was uncomfortable but freeing. It forced me to look at myself not as a victim of my upbringing, but as someone responsible for unlearning, growing, and making conscious choices.
      <br />
      <br />
      Does my past make me a bad person simply because I once got it wrong? I don't think so. If anything, it's what gave me the wisdom I have now. Mistakes are painful teachers, but they teach lessons that comfort never could. What defines a person isn't just the errors they've made, it's what they do afterward, how they carry that awareness forward, and the kind of person they fight to become. Growth doesn't erase the past, but it transforms it into something meaningful. It turns regret into reflection, and guilt into guidance.
      <br />
      <br />
      But.. who gets to decide what justice truly is? A judge who was raped as a child might carry deep personal pain into their courtroom. If a rapist stood trial before them, their judgment, no matter how disciplined they try to be, would inevitably be influenced by that trauma. They might impose a harsher sentence than a judge who had never experienced that kind of suffering. And who could blame them? They're human. We all are. No matter how impartial we claim to be, emotion always bleeds into reason. So how can it ever be fair for one imperfect person to decide the fate of another?
      <br />
      <br />
      Who has the right to tell me, or anyone, what is absolutely right and absolutely wrong? Over time, we've learned that morality isn't some divine law written in stone, it's a social contract, an agreement built on collective consensus. What we call “justice” is really a reflection of what most people, in a given time and place, collectively agree it should look like. But that consensus changes. What's righteous today could be condemned tomorrow. Hence the History segue I mentioned earlier.
      <br />
      <br />
      If the vast majority of people suddenly decided that running across an empty street was “bad,” would that make you a bad person for doing it? There's no harm in it, no victim, no consequence, so where's the moral weight? It's only “wrong” because people said so. That's the strange thing about morality: it often depends less on the act itself and more on how society perceives it. We obey rules not always because they're inherently just, but because we've been taught to.
      <br />
      <br />
      When you really think about it, morality and justice are human inventions, imperfect systems built by imperfect people trying to make sense of a chaotic world. And if that's the case, maybe being “good” isn't about following every rule or fitting into every standard, but about striving to live with integrity and compassion even when the rules themselves are flawed.
      <br />
      <br />
      So, what makes someone a bad person? I don't think there's a universal answer to that question. Maybe being “bad” isn't about the action itself, but about the intent behind it, the reasoning, the awareness, the choice. Stealing out of greed is different from stealing out of hunger. Killing for power is different from killing to protect. The heart behind the action matters just as much as the action itself.
      <br />
      <br />
      To me, being a bad person means intentionally causing harm when you have the choice not to. It means knowing your actions will hurt others and doing them anyway. But beyond that, morality exists in shades of gray. It's a reflection of the world we live in, the people we become, and the lessons we're taught along the way.
      <br />
      <br />
      At fourteen, I thought the answer was simple. Now, I realize the question itself is what makes us human, because the moment we start asking what makes someone bad, we also start searching for what makes someone good.
      <br />
      <br />
      So maybe the real question isn't “What makes someone bad?”, but rather, how far away are any of us from becoming the person we once thought we'd never be?
