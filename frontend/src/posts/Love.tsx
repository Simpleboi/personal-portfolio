        Love is one of the most commonly used words in the English language, yet
        one of the hardest to define. Everyone I meet seems to carry their own
        version of what love is, and that fascinates me. Some shaped by their
        experiences, heartbreaks, and hopes. Some describe it as a feeling,
        others as a choice. Some say it's comfort, others say it's chaos. And
        honestly, that difference is what intrigues me. Because maybe love
        doesn't have one meaning at all, maybe it changes with each person who
        feels it.
        <br />
        <br />
        For as long as I can remember, I've been searching for what love truly
        is. Not the butterflies in your stomach or the late-night conversations,
        but the essence of it, the part that makes people stay, forgive, and
        grow together.
        <br />
        <br />I still remember November 10th, 2019, like it was yesterday. I was
        sixteen, sitting in my room writing my first essay about love. I had
        just entered my first real relationship, and I was completely and
        recklessly in love. Everything felt new, every text, every hug, every “
        <em>I love you</em>” felt infinite. I had no trust issues, no doubts, no
        reason to protect myself. I was young, open, and all-in. I loved my
        girlfriend at the time with everything I had. I wrote deeply about love
        in that essay because I was so excited to have finally
        understood what people meant when they told me "
        <em>wait until you're in love</em>". or so I thought.
        <br />
        <br />
        Then December 2019 came. I went on vacation for a week, and when I came
        back, I found out my girlfriend had cheated on me. I remember standing
        there, not even angry at first, but confused. I was replaying every
        memory, every word she'd said. She told me she loved me and I believed
        her. I trusted her. And yet... here I was, trying to make sense of
        something that didn't make sense at all.
        <br />
        <br />
        Was that love? Was love something that could disappear so easily? Was it
        really as fragile as it felt in that moment? But she said she loved me.
        Was love that conditional? That easy to betray? I was more confused than
        sad
        <br />
        <br />
        That day didn't just break me, it changed how I saw love altogether. It
        made me question everything: How could I tell someone “
        <em>I love you</em>” if I didn't even know what those words meant
        anymore? I wanted to understand love beyond the surface.
        <br />
        <br />
        And that's when I started asking harder questions. How do you learn to
        trust someone again after they've lied to you? or <em>
          Should you?
        </em>{" "}
        Because once trust is broken, it doesn't just live in that one moment,
        it bleeds into everything else. It stains the past, making you question
        what was ever real, and it shadows the future, whispering doubt into
        every new promise. How can you believe what you hear now when
        yesterday's truth turned out to be a lie?
        <br />
        <br />
        For a long time, I thought forgiveness and trust were the same thing,
        that if I could learn to forgive, then trust would eventually return.
        But they're not the same. Forgiveness is letting go of the past; trust
        is believing in the future. Forgiveness is internal, something you give
        yourself to release the weight. Trust is external, it's something
        someone has to earn back. This distinction took me years to understand.
        <br />
        <br />
        In those years, I began looking for love in new places, not necessarily
        in people, but in small things. In sunsets that reminded me the world
        still had beauty. In music that spoke what I couldn't say out loud. In
        late-night talks with friends who made me feel safe again. Slowly, I
        realized love isn't just something that happens between two people, it's
        also the compassion you show yourself when you're trying to heal.
        <br />
        <br />
        Philosophers call love the force that binds humanity together.
        Scientists describe it as a mix of dopamine, oxytocin, and attachment
        circuits. Poets call it a mystery that language will never be big enough
        to hold. And somehow, all of those definitions coexist, because love is
        all of those things at once. It's both biological and spiritual,
        rational and irrational, grounded and infinite.
        <br />
        <br />
        And from what I've gathered, love isn't supposed to be easy. It demands
        honesty when it's inconvenient, patience when it's hard, and forgiveness
        even when it hurts. Love tests you, it asks if you can stay open in a
        world that gives you every reason to close off.
        <br />
        <br />
        But when love is real, when it's steady, selfless, and safe, it changes
        everything. It gives life depth. It turns ordinary moments into sacred
        ones. It reminds you that despite the lies, the heartbreak, and the
        confusion, there's still something pure about choosing to believe again.
        <br />
        <br />
        As for me, I don't know if I'll ever be <em>in love again</em>. I can love, I
        know how to care deeply, how to show up for people, how to see beauty in
        their smallest details. I can listen, I can nurture, I can give. That
        part of me never left. But to be <em>in love</em>, that effortless
        surrender, that blind faith in something fragile, that's different. It's
        something I've grown to accept may never happen for me.
        <br />
        <br />
        Maybe it's because I've seen what love can do when it turns out bad. How
        it can take everything soft and honest in you and leave it trembling in
        the aftermath. Maybe it's because I've learned too much, about how
        easily people say forever, and how quickly forever fades. There's a kind
        of innocence you lose once your heart's been broken, and I think mine
        never found its way back.
        <br />
        <br />
        I still believe in connection, though, in the quiet understanding
        between two souls, in small moments of warmth that make life softer. I
        believe in care, in friendship, in laughter that feels like sunlight.
        But love, the kind that makes you lose track of where you end and
        someone else begins, I don't chase that anymore. When I say that I can
        love, but not be in love, I mean that I still have compassion, but I no
        longer have faith in the fairytale.
        <br />
        <br />
        Maybe one day it'll find me, in some quiet way I couldn't anticipate.
        But if it doesn't, that's okay too. I've learned that life can still be
        full without being <em>in love</em>. That meaning can come from
        creation, from purpose, from kindness. That loving, even without the
        promise of being loved back the same way, can still be enough.
        Sometimes, people reach a point where they stop searching for love, not
        because they don't want it, but because they've made peace with the idea
        that they don't <em>need</em> it to feel whole. It's a strange kind of
        freedom. You stop expecting love to save you, and start realizing that
        your life, your craft, your friendships, your growth, all of it, can
        hold meaning on their own.
        <br />
        <br />
        Deep down, I think people who say this often have{" "}
        <em>known love too deeply</em>. You've felt it, lost it, and watched it
        change you in ways words can't fully explain. So part of you steps back
        and says, “
        <em>
          Maybe that kind of love isn't meant for me, not in the way I imagined.
        </em>
        ” But maybe it's not about giving up. Maybe it's just about resting.
        About letting your heart breathe after being stretched too many times.
        And if love does find its way back to you someday, it'll have to arrive
        differently, not loud and blinding like before, but quiet, patient, and
        honest.
        <br />
        <br />
        I've loved before, deeply and sincerely. I've felt the highs that make
        your heart warm and the lows that hollow you out completely. But love
        has a way of changing you, and sometimes it takes more than it gives
        back. Somewhere along the line, I stopped waiting for it to return. I
        stopped expecting it to.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now, I just want to create. To build. To do what I was meant to do while
        I'm still here. If love never finds me again, I'll still pour my heart
        into my work, into the things that last. The projects, the words, the
        late nights spent chasing something bigger than myself. That's where my
        devotion lives now. Maybe I was never meant to be someone's great love
        story. Maybe I was simply meant to build, to think, to lead and to leave
        something behind that matters. And if that's how my story ends, quietly
        and without romance, but full of purpose, then I can live with that.
        <br />
        <br />
        I don't need love to complete me anymore. I just need time, passion, and
        the will to keep moving forward. I'll work until I can't. I'll give
        everything I have to what I believe in. And when the day comes that my
        time is done, I'll know I didn't waste it waiting for something that was
        never promised to me.
        <br />
        <br />
        Maybe that's not sadness, maybe that's freedom, and maybe that is its own kind of peace.
