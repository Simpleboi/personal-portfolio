        Since I was young, something that's never sat right with me are gender
        stereotypes. As a kid I always wondered why men and women were expected
        to behave a certain way, why there was this invisible list of rules for
        how we should act. I enjoyed the things that I enjoyed, simple as that,
        until someone told me it wasn't “manly” or that I “shouldn't” be doing
        it. That was the first time I realized how tightly people cling to these
        boxes.
        <br />
        <br />
        One consequence of these stereotypes is the belief that every man is supposed to be a natural leader. But the thing is, I'm not. I don't crave being the one in charge. I'm more comfortable following, being guided, or working alongside someone rather than above them. And I've gotten a surprising amount of backlash for that preference. At one point, someone I cared about betrayed me and became intimate with another guy because, in her words, he “took charge” more than I did. He was more controlling, more dominant, and she found that attractive. Hearing that really hurt me, not just emotionally, but in a way that made me question myself.
        <br />
        <br />
        For a while, it pushed me into a box I didn't fit in. I tried to behave more aggressively, more dominant, more “<em>manly,</em>” hoping it would make me feel worthy. But forcing myself into that role only made me resent myself. Eventually I learned something important: if someone cheats on me or leaves me because I don't fit their specific stereotype of what a man should be, then they were never meant to be in my life in the first place. I don't need to twist myself into someone else's definition of masculinity, especially when the person I am isn't hurting anyone.
        <br />
        <br />
        I've grown to <strong>strongly</strong> reject gender stereotypes. People act like a man isn't a “<em>real man</em>” unless he works a traditionally masculine job like construction, trades, manual labor. Meanwhile, I spend my days writing code, building software, and creating things with my brain more than with my hands. But somehow society has made men who sit at computers feel less legitimate than men who pick up tools. I wish I was lying but I've literally been made fun of because my hands are clean, not covered in dirt or bruises. And that's one of the stupidest things I've had to witness.
        <br />
        <br />
        This ties into something deeper: the way men are taught to process emotions. There's a stigma that says men should be stoic, emotionless, and silent about their struggles. Showing vulnerability is still seen as weak. I've watched close friends go through dark battles completely alone because they're terrified of being laughed at or judged. And for what? Because they expressed a feeling? Because they opened up for five seconds? This stereotype is destroying men from the inside out.
        <br />
        <br />
        When you're raised being told to “<em>man up,</em>” “<em>shake it off,</em>” or “<em>stop being dramatic,</em>” you start to believe that your emotions are something to be hidden, not understood. Repressing feelings doesn't make them disappear, it just forces them underground where they grow into anger, irritability, or complete emotional shutdown. A lot of men don't even realize they're hurting because they've been conditioned to numb every uncomfortable feeling instead of processing it, myself included.
        <br />
        <br />
        This emotional suppression shows up everywhere, especially in relationships. Many men struggle to communicate what they feel, not because they don't care or because they're incapable of emotional depth, but because they were never given a safe space to practice. Vulnerability feels foreign, embarrassing, and even dangerous. So instead of opening up, men stay quiet, hoping their partner somehow reads their mind. This disconnect creates tension, arguments, and misunderstandings because society taught men that expressing love, fear, insecurity, or even sadness makes them “less of a man.” It's heartbreaking really how many relationships fall apart simply because someone was taught to hide their humanity.
        <br />
        <br />
        Living inside a persona, especially one that doesn't match who you truly are, drains your mental health. When you're constantly performing, constantly trying to be the “strong one” or the “leader” or the “unshakeable man,” you lose touch with the parts of yourself that actually need care. You might feel anxious but pretend to be confident. You might feel lonely but act like you're fine. Over time, this kind of emotional dissonance builds into depression, burnout, and self-hatred. It's impossible to heal when you're not allowed to admit you're hurt.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is why emotional awareness matters so much. This is why spaces like <a href="https://journalxp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JournalXP</a> exist, to give people a place to feel without fear, without judgment, without needing to perform a role. When stereotypes tell you who you're supposed to be, journaling gives you a moment to ask yourself who you actually are. And the truth is that men deserve that freedom. Men deserve softness. Men deserve emotional clarity. Men deserve to be whole human beings, not characters playing out someone else's script.
        <br />
        <br />
        Another piece of this whole issue is the growing “gender war.” Every day online, men and women are arguing about who has it worse, who's superior, who is “the prize,” who deserves more respect. This debate really pisses me off because so much of it revolves around telling people what they're allowed to do. If a woman wants to dress more masculine, why should that upset anyone? If she isn't hurting anyone, why does her clothing become a debate? The same goes for men who don't fit the stereotype. People act like individuality is a threat rather than a simple personal choice.
        <br />
        <br />
        Even though I speak from my experience as a man, the gender stereotypes don't only limit men, they limit everyone. Women are boxed in by expectations just as harsh and suffocating. They're often told that their value comes from being soft, submissive, nurturing, or effortlessly beautiful. They're expected to look a certain way, speak a certain way, and behave in a way that keeps other people comfortable, "lady like" if you will. And if they dare to step outside those boundaries, if they're assertive, ambitious, outspoken, or too independent, they're suddenly labeled “masculine,” “too much,” or “undesirable.” It's the same trap, just in a different form.
        <br />
        <br />
        I've seen women struggle with feeling like they're failing femininity because they don't naturally fit the mold. Some women don't enjoy wearing makeup, dressing traditionally feminine, or becoming caretakers, and yet society pressures them into believing these roles are mandatory. Others fear being seen as “bossy” or “aggressive” for simply expressing confidence or setting boundaries. The irony is that women are criticized whether they embrace traditional roles or reject them. No matter what they choose, someone has an opinion about what they “<em>should</em>” be doing.
        <br />
        <br />
        And that's really the core issue: stereotypes don't give anyone room to be human. They reduce people to templates instead of allowing individuality. Men are expected to be strong, emotionless leaders. Women are expected to be gentle, compliant supporters. But real people aren't that simple. Real people exist on a spectrum of personality, emotion, ambition and identity. When we force everyone into rigid gender roles, we rob them of the opportunity to discover who they actually are.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is why I believe these stereotypes hurt both sides. They create resentment, misunderstanding, and conflict because neither group is being truly seen or understood. Men end up feeling like failures for not being dominant enough; women end up feeling like failures for not being submissive enough. Nobody wins in that system. It doesn't build healthier relationships or stronger individuals; it just creates pressure, shame, and confusion.
        <br />
        <br />
        When I talk about breaking stereotypes, I'm not only advocating for men, I'm advocating for everyone. Because the truth is that we're all better off when people are free to define themselves. Strength, softness, leadership, creativity, independence, vulnerability, none of these traits belong to one gender. They belong to human beings.
        <br />
        <br />
        After seeing how harmful these stereotypes can be, I can't help but imagine a world that looks different, a world where people don't feel trapped inside labels they never asked for. I imagine a world where men are allowed to feel without being called weak, where crying isn't treated like a flaw, and where gentleness isn't mistaken for a lack of masculinity. A world where emotional intelligence is seen as strength, not softness. Men should be able to express fear, sadness, joy, confusion, whatever they're experiencing, without the fear of being judged or laughed at.
        <br />
        <br />
        I also imagine a world where women can be strong, assertive, outspoken, or independent without being labeled “masculine” or “too much.” Where they don't get punished socially or romantically for having ambition or confidence. A world where their strength doesn't threaten anyone and where they don't have to shrink themselves to make others comfortable. Women deserve the same freedom to exist without constantly being told they're doing womanhood “wrong.”
        <br />
        <br />
        In this vision, gender isn't a battlefield. It isn't a competition, or a hierarchy, or some endless argument about who has it harder or who is “the prize.” Instead, gender becomes something simple, just a part of who we are, not the entire blueprint of our behavior. Differences wouldn't divide us; they would just be differences. We'd stop trying to enforce rules on each other and start learning how to respect individuality. People would be encouraged to explore their identity, not confined by it.
        <br />
        <br />
        And in that world, relationships would look completely different too. They'd be built on compatibility, not stereotypes. A couple wouldn't fall apart because the man isn't “dominant enough” or the woman isn't “submissive enough.” Instead, they'd value communication, emotional safety, mutual support, and shared values. People would choose partners based on how they connect, not how closely they fit a script society wrote for them.
        <br />
        <br />
        That's the world I wish we lived in, a world where you're allowed to be yourself without apology. A world where humanity comes before expectations. And even if we aren't there yet, it's a vision worth working toward, one conversation and one mindset at a time.
        <br />
        <br />
        And before anybody twists this into something political, let me be clear: I'm not speaking from a political standpoint. I'm not a democrat or a republican. I don't follow politics or engage in political debates. These are simply observations, things I've seen, experiences I've lived through, and problems I see happening in the world around me.
        <br />
        <br />
        At the end of the day, my point is simple: people should be allowed to exist as they are without being shoved into gender roles or judged for not fitting a stereotype. We'd all be a lot healthier if we stopped trying to perform an identity and started accepting humanity for what it really is, diverse, complex, and incredibly individual.
