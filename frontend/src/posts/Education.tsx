        Education has always been a taboo subject for me. For most of my
        childhood, I struggled with it, battled with it, and often felt like it
        wasn't built for someone like me. It wasn't until I got to high school
        that I began to truly value education for what it could be, not just
        what it demanded from me.
        <br />
        <br />
        When I was younger, I did poorly in school. I wasn't unintelligent, I was just lost. With twenty to thirty students packed into a classroom, it was nearly impossible for the teacher to give me the extra help I needed. I fell behind early, and once you fall behind in the traditional system, it's hard to catch up. I spent years confused, frustrated, and quietly defeated.
        <br />
        <br />
        Back then, I didn't know how to study or even <em>how</em> to learn. My grades dropped so low that my mother eventually pulled me out of public school going into seventh grade. She had never homeschooled anyone before and, like many parents, struggled to teach subjects in math and science. Because I wasn't on grade level, she gave me materials that were a year or two below my grade just so I could rebuild some foundation.
        <br />
        <br />
        The truth is, my mom didn't understand the coursework much better than I did, and that turned out to be a blessing in disguise. It forced me to start teaching myself. For the first time, I had to make sense of things on my own. I stopped taking formulas and facts at face value and started asking <em>why</em>. Without the pressure of a 45-minute class period or a bell schedule, I finally had time to slow down and think deeply. I wasn't just memorizing anymore; I was discovering.
        <br />
        <br />
        I began to understand <em>why</em> equations worked, <em>how</em> they were derived, and where they came from. That shift, going from accepting information to questioning it, changed everything for me. I realized that anything can be learned if it's taught the right way. People don't fail because they can't learn; they fail because they were never shown how to learn.
        <br />
        <br />
        I carried that mindset with me for years. Back in seventh grade, I couldn't even do fractions, a fifth-grade concept. Fast-forward to today, and I've completed Calculus I, II, and III, along with Differential Equations and Linear Algebra to name a few. It didn't happen overnight, but I grew to see education differently. It's not about memorizing that x + y = z; it's about understanding <em>why</em> x + y = z.
        <br />
        <br />
        That belief eventually led me to become a STEM tutor at my college, and later, at the time I am writing this, a Supplemental Instructor for programming courses like Object-Oriented Programming, Python, C++, and Data Structures & Algorithms. Standing on the other side of the classroom taught me more about education than any textbook ever could.
        <br />
        <br />
        I spent three years of my life homeschooled, from seventh to ninth grade, before returning to public school my freshman year of high school. Those years of independent learning changed me in ways I couldn't have imagined. When I went back to the classroom, I carried the study habits, patience, and curiosity I had developed on my own.
        <br />
        <br />
        Before homeschooling, my grades were painfully low. I was constantly at risk of failing and felt like I was falling further behind every year. But by the time I re-entered public school, everything was different. I finally understood how to learn, not just what to learn. I no longer memorized information to pass a test and forget it later. I learned to connect concepts, to explore, and to ask questions.
        <br />
        <br />
        That shift completely transformed my academic life. When I returned to public school as a freshman in high school, everything felt different. I excelled in my classes, earning nearly a 4.0 GPA and ranking ninth in my class. I passed my STAAR exams with near-perfect scores, missing only a question or two, and by sophomore year, I was enrolled in nearly all AP and Pre-AP courses. For the first time, I wasn't just surviving school; I was thriving in it. Not because I suddenly became “smart,” but because I had finally learned <em>how to think for myself</em>.
        <br /> 
        <br />
        Education became something deeply personal to me. I fell in love with learning for the sake of learning, not because I was told to, but because I wanted to understand the world around me. To me, that's what real education is: not memorizing facts under pressure, but chasing understanding out of passion.
        <br /> 
        <br />
        Now, when I help other students as a tutor and instructor, I try to pass that mindset on. I want them to see that learning isn't something you're forced to do, it's something you <em>get</em> to do. Knowledge isn't a burden; it's freedom. And I hope to inspire others to see education not as an obligation, but as a lifelong pursuit of curiosity. 
        <br />
        <br />
        When I started teaching, I saw the same look in my students' eyes that I used to have, the quiet confusion, the fear of asking questions, and the belief that they just “aren't smart enough.” It broke me a little inside because I knew that feeling too well. I realized then that the problem wasn't with the students, it was with the system that shaped them.
        <br />
        <br />
        In modern education, the focus is on efficiency, not understanding. Teachers are forced to rush through lessons to meet state standards and test requirements. Students are graded on memorization, not comprehension. Success is defined by numbers on a page, not by genuine curiosity or creativity.
        <br />
        <br />
        But real learning doesn't happen under pressure, it happens in moments of <em>patience and connection</em>. It happens when a teacher slows down and says, “Let's go over this again, together.” It happens when a student finally understands a concept they thought they never could. That's where education lives, in those sparks of realization, not in test scores.
        <br />
        <br />
        I also learned that teaching isn't about being the smartest person in the room. It's about being the most <em>understanding</em>. A good teacher doesn't make the material easier, they make the student feel capable of understanding something difficult. They don't stand above the student; they stand beside them.
        <br />
        <br />
        What I've learned is that there's no one-size-fits-all way to learn. Some students thrive in group settings, others learn best independently. Some need visual examples; others need hands-on practice. Everyone's brain speaks a slightly different language, yet our education system tries to teach everyone the same way.
        <br />
        <br />
        That's the problem I have with the modern education system, it doesn't teach students to love learning; it teaches them to fear failure. Schools are designed to create workers, not thinkers. Creativity, curiosity, and individuality are treated as distractions instead of strengths.
        <br />
        <br />
        Here in Texas, students spend nearly an entire year preparing for the STAAR test, one high-stakes exam that supposedly measures your understanding of a subject. But in reality, it measures your ability to remember, not your ability to <em>reason</em>. A student can pass that test without truly learning anything, and another student can fail it despite having incredible critical thinking skills.
        <br />
        <br />
        The irony is that school teaches you that failure is something to avoid, yet in real life, <em>failure</em> is <em>how you learn</em>. Every mistake carries a lesson, but the current system punishes mistakes instead of exploring them. That's why so many students lose motivation, they're afraid of being wrong.
        <br />
        <br />
        Through teaching, I started to see education differently. It's not just about transferring information, it's about transforming how people <em>think</em>. My job as an educator isn't to tell someone what to know, but to help them realize they <em>can</em> know it.
        <br />
        <br />
        Education should be personal, patient, and empowering. It should adapt to the student, not the other way around. Some students learn visually, others by doing. Some need structure; others need freedom. If schools prioritized understanding how people learn over what people must learn, we'd create a generation of thinkers instead of test-takers.
        <br />
        <br />
        When a student tells me, “I'm just not a math person,” I smile and say, “You were never taught your way.” Because that's what education should be, a discovery of your way.
        <br />
        <br />
        I used to hate education because I thought it hated me. Now I see that what I hated wasn't learning, it was the system that made learning feel impossible. Once I broke away from that, I fell in love with understanding.
        <br />
        <br />
        Teaching gave me a sense of purpose. It made me realize that I want to help others avoid the pain I once felt, to show them that intelligence isn't something you're born with, it's something you build.
        <br />
        <br />
        When I look back on my younger self, the kid who couldn't do fractions in seventh grade, I don't feel shame anymore. I feel gratitude. Because that struggle shaped me into someone who doesn't just want to learn, but wants to teach differently.
        <br />
        <br />
        Education shouldn't just teach you what to think, it should teach you how to think, why to think, and how to never stop.
        <br />
        <br />
        Maybe that's what real education is: not about filling minds, but about awakening them.
        <br />
        <br />
        and if there's one thing I've learned through all of this, it's this, the moment you stop learning just to pass, and start learning to understand, that's when education truly begins.
