        This blog post is a bit different. It isn't about computer science or
        programming, it's a journey through thoughts that may bring comfort to
        some while challenging others. I built this blog to write about
        anything, so I can write about <i>anything</i> yeah?
        <br />
        <br />
        From a very young age, I was fascinated by the world of engineering. I
        spent countless hours with Legos, molding creations out of play-dough,
        and solving puzzles that stretched my imagination. Math, with its
        promise that every problem holds a solution, captivated me. I found
        great joy in solving complex questions and uncovering answers that
        seemed hidden. This early passion for problem-solving instilled in me a
        mindset that seeks clarity and logical conclusions, making unresolved or
        abstract issues particularly unsettling.
        <br />
        <br />
        I was raised in Christianity, a faith deeply ingrained in me from birth.
        As I grew older, however, I struggled to reconcile its teachings with my
        logical approach to life. My mind often clashed with doctrines that
        couldn't be proven or fully explained, leading to a persistent inner
        conflict. I found myself under constant persecution for not 'believing
        the right way,' as defined by those around me, more specifically my
        parents. When I had problems or challenges, the most common response was
        always, ‚ÄúPray about it.‚Äù While spoken with a good heart, this advice left me
        yearning for tangible solutions, a concrete path forward rather than
        more questions that deepened my uncertainty.
        <br />
        <br />
        In an effort to secure my parents' pride and approval, I adopted a
        facade of unwavering contentment and compliance. I became a
        people-pleaser, constantly reshaping my personality to fit the mold of
        what others expected. In the process, I lost sight of who I truly was,
        surrendering my authentic self to the pressure of meeting external
        expectations.
        <br />
        <br />
        The struggle to reconcile my inner logical voice with the demands of my
        upbringing eventually led me into a deep depression. Each day became a
        battle with my mental health, where even the simplest tasks, like
        engaging in hobbies, writing code, or even leaving my bed, felt like
        climbing mount everest. I questioned the direction of my life, plagued
        by a sense of isolation and inadequacy. I felt like I had no true
        purpose, no sense of direction that aligned with my own personal views.
        <br />
        <br />
        The harsh judgment from others, as if I were constantly on trial for my
        thoughts and feelings, only added to my depression. It felt as though
        society was quick to criticize, reminding me that everyone was flawed.
        This relentless pressure made it even harder to see a clear path
        forward. I even pondered on the idea of suicide, a permant solution to a
        temporary problem.
        <br />
        <br />
        Neglecting my emotional well-being had placed a heavy toll on my life,
        destroying the things I held most dear. This realization was a turning
        point, a call to action that propelled me to reclaim my identity and
        well-being. In the midst of darkness, I slowly came to realize just how
        essential mental well-being truly is, and how idiotic I was for always
        neglecting it.
        <br />
        <br />
        In response to this personal awakening, I started on a project close to
        my heart: a mental health web app called <a href="https://github.com/Simpleboi/JournalXP" target="_blank">JournalXP</a>. This app is designed
        to support emotional awareness and growth in a game-like manner, providing
        a space where thoughts and feelings can be explored and understood. The
        source code is available on GitHub for anyone who might be curious or
        inspired to learn more about it.
        <br />
        <br />
        Today, I've reached a place where I no longer let the opinions and
        judgments of others dictate my path. I am dedicated to rediscovering who
        I truly am, free from the need to conform to others' expectations.
        Instead of chasing validation, I am focused on embracing my emotions and
        carving out a future that aligns with my true self. This journey is not
        just about overcoming past struggles; it's about celebrating the freedom
        to be authentic and fully present in my own life.

        pushing forward, keep putting in the effort, but don't forget to speak
        kindly to yourself along the way. There's no single 'right' path in
        life. You're not late. You're not behind. You're exactly where you need

        respected and proud garbage collector out there. Your value isn't tied
        to the title, it's tied to your heart and the effort you give. This
        post might not be about computer science or programming, but it felt
        important enough to share. So if you're reading this, thank you. And I
        hope today brings you peace, purpose, and maybe even a little joy. Stay
