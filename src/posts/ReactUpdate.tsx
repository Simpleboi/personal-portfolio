        I started using React.js in June 2024 while diving deeper into web
        development. Up until that point, I hadn't used any libraries or
        frameworks, just the classic trio of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with
        everything in its own file and structure. To give you a sense of where I
        started, feel free to check out the code for one of my earliest
        projects, a simple{" "}

        app from April 2024. It's beginner work for sure, and any experienced
        developer might get a chuckle out of it, but that's the beauty of
        growth. Like anyone improving their craft, I kept practicing and
        eventually turned to React to level up my web dev skills.
        <br />
        <br />
        The learning curve was steep, and the shift in mindset took some time to
        adjust to. To get started, I followed Codecademy's Front-End Engineering
        path and watched a bunch of YouTube tutorials. One of the first things
        that stood out was JSX. At first, writing HTML-like code inside
        JavaScript felt odd but over time, I grew to really enjoy it's style.
        JSX, paired with functional components, quickly became one of my
        favorite parts of React. The reusability and clarity it brought to my UI
        development felt amazing and I wondered why I handn't used it before.
        <br />
        <br />
        That said, not everything came easily. Learning how props worked and how
        data flowed between components was a real struggle in the beginning. To
        add to the challenge, I was learning TypeScript at the same time, so I
        was jumping straight into <code>.tsx</code> files while still trying to
        understand the fundamentals of React itself. It was overwhelming, but it
        forced me to think more clearly about component structure and typing,
        which ended up being a blessing in disguise.
        <br />
        <br />
        One aspect of React that really confused me at first was the single-page
        application approach. Coming from static HTML pages, I was used to
        separating content across individual files. React's dynamic routing and
        the idea of rendering everything from a single root component felt
        foreign at first, but it eventually made sense, and became something I
        now appreciate.
        <br />
        <br />
        To apply what I was learning, I started simple and built a basic To-Do
        app. That small project helped me understand component-based design and
        how to use useState in a real context. Hooks felt strange at first and
        took awhile for me to really understand it, but once I used them
        practically, they started to click. That project gave me a better
        understanding of how React handles interactivity and reactivityâ€”things I
        had only ever done manually before with vanilla JavaScript.
        <br />
        <br />
        As I continued building more complex apps, I ran into common React
        challenges: lifting state, managing async behavior, figuring out when to
        use conditional rendering, and trying to organize my files in a logical,
        scalable way. These weren't just surface-level problems, they were
        architectural decisions that made me realize React offers flexibility,
        but demands discipline and clear thinking in return. It taught me a lot
        about Web Architecutre and it's something I appreciate.
        <br />
        <br />
        By December 2024, I began exploring routing with React Router, which
        opened up multi-page navigation and changed how I structured my apps. I
        implemented it in this web portfolio and haven't looked back. Around the
        same time, I started using the Context API for global state in a few
        projects, which helped reduce prop drilling and made it easier to share
        data across multiple components.
        <br />
        <br />
        In early 2025, I focused more on building dynamic, interactive UIs,
        handling forms, modals, loading states, and began learning full-stack
        concepts. I started using Firebase to manage authentication, sessions,
        and databases. It allowed me to focus on the front end while still
        understanding how a full application works from top to bottom.
        <br />
        <br />
        I've since used React in several major projects of mine, including
        JournalXP, SparkCSS, and Genesis. Each project has helped me grow more
        confident with the ecosystem and refine my code style, component
        structure, and understanding of performance. I've also adopted modern
        tools like Vite and Next.js to streamline builds and improve developer
        experience.
        <br />
        <br />
        As of today, June 23rd, 2025, I genuinely enjoy using React. It's become
        my go-to library for building web apps. While it isn't perfect, and can
        become messy without clear patterns and structure, React gives me the
        control and flexibility I value as a developer. I've learned that
        simplicity and modularity are the key to keeping things maintainable.
        <br />
        <br />
        I explored other libraries like Svelte and Vue but they never had the
        same effect on me that React did so unless a job specifically requires
        Vue or Svelte, I don't see myself switching any time soon. React works
        for me, and I'm excited to keep growing with it.
