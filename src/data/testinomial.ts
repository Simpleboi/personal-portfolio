      "Nathaniel and I worked together on our college's Computer Science Club website. While I handled the design and color choices, he took on the technical side, managing the scripting and content. As president of the club, he helped introduce topics that went beyond what we learned in class, like navigating the job market or programming practices that aren't usually covered in coursework. His passion for learning and diving into new challenges really stood out to me; it's a mindset I believe every CS student should have. In a field where experience outside the classroom matters just as much as grades, he's one of the few who genuinely put in that extra effort.",

    quote: "Nate and I worked together in a local STEM challenge. During the coding portion, he focused on the most difficult of the prompts while the rest of us either implemented code or wrote pseudocode for the many simple prompts. He was also the President in our Computer Science club. He was always encouraging us to learn, and excited to give the week's presentation. Nate shows his passion for programing with his many side projects and truly pushes himself to be the best. He will be an asset to any team.",
